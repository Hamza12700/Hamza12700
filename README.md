# Hi, I'm Hamza Rashid
**I'm a self-taugh developer. Learning backend development and low-level programming.**

I’ve been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built my
first Go project, “cryptos”. The consolidate toolchain makes me want to leave
the JS ecosystem behind for good. I’m currently looking for a role in backend
web development, ideally written Go, Rust or Python. I’d especially love to
work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If
you're hiring, let's chat!
