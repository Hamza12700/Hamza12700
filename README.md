# Hi, I'm Hamza Rashid
**I'm a self-taugh developer. Learning backend development and low-level programming.**

My favorite daily activities are learning about low-level concepts and performance optimization.<br/>
I daily drive **Arch Linux** and **Hyprland** Window Manager, and I also use *neovim* by the way.

I love building *backend services*, optimizing them, and creating command-line interface (CLI) applications to automate tedious tasks.
Why spend 6 minutes doing it manually when you can just automate it in 5 hours.

## My Work
Projects that I'm working on:

- [Drash](https://github.com/hamza12700/drash): A better alternative to Linux `rm`.
> **Drash** records the original path of the file which was
> removed, and storing it user's local share directory making it easy to
> recovery them later if you accidentally deleted the wrong file. 

## Get in Touch
I'm currently looking for a role in backend web development. Iâ€™d especially love to
work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If
you're hiring, let's chat!
