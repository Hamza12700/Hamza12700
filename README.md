# Hi, I'm Hamza Rashid

**I'm a self-taugh engineer. Learning backend and low-level programming**

I love learning about low-level programming concepts, playing with memory,
understanding how the computer works under the hood and making software fast and reliable.

## Projects that I'm working on:

- [drash](https://github.com/hamza12700/drash): A better alternative to Linux `rm` command.

- [surf](https://github.com/wavly/surf): Web tool for shortening long URLs.
