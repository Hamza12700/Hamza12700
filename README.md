# Hi, I'm Hamza Rashid
**I'm a self-taugh developer. Learning backend development and low-level programming.**

My favorite daily activities are learning about low-level concepts and performance optimization.<br/>
I daily drive **Arch Linux** and **Hyprland** Window Manager, and I also use ***neovim*** by the way.

I love building *backend services*, optimizing them, and creating command-line interface (CLI) applications to automate tedious tasks.
Why spend 6 minutes doing it manually when you can just automate it in 5 hours.

## My Work
**Projects that I'm working on**:

- [Drash](https://github.com/hamza12700/drash) - (`RUST`, `Linux`): A better alternative to Linux `rm` command<br/>
It records the original path of the file which was removed, and storing it
user's local share directory making it easy to recovery them later if you
accidentally deleted the wrong file. 
  Search multiple files in the trash and restore them<br/>
  Search multiple files in current working directory and put them into the trash<br/>
  List files and directories in the trash-can, specifying each file-type (file or directory)<br/>
  [Clap](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap) for command-line argument parsing<br/>

- [Wavly/Shawty](https://github.com/wavly/shawty) - (`GO`): Tool for shortening long URL<br/>
Minimalistic web interface built using Go's standard `html/template` package and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).<br/>
Keeping track of clicks on abbreviated URL and when it was last accessed.<br/>
**Input Validation**:<br/>
  Only allow `HTTPS` URL schema.<br/>
  Checks if URL contains a valid TLD (Top-Level Domain).<br/>
  [Turso](https://turso.tech) SQLITE for storage.<br/>
  [HTMX](https://htmx.org) for dynamic Web UI.<br/>

## Get in Touch
I'm currently looking for a role in backend development. Iâ€™d especially love to
