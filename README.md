# Hi, I'm Hamza Rashid
**I'm a self-taugh developer. Learning backend development and low-level programming.**

My favorite daily activities are learning about low-level concepts and performance optimization.<br/>
I daily drive **Linux** and I also use ***neovim*** by the way.

I love building *backend services*, optimizing them, and creating command-line interface (CLI) applications to automate tedious tasks.
Why spend 6 minutes doing it manually when you can just automate it in 5 hours.

## Things I've built:

**Projects that I'm working on**:

- [drash](https://github.com/hamza12700/drash): A better alternative to Linux `rm` command.

- [surf](https://github.com/wavly/surf): Web tool for shortening long URLs.
