## Hamza Rashid

I'm a system's programmer, I like creating softwares/programs for Linux and Unix-like systems. I also love creating custom parsers or parsing logic for things like custom config-files or whatever it is.

Things, I've built and still improving them:

- [drash](https://github.com/hamza12700/drash) - A better and simple alternative to linux `rm` command.
