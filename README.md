# Hi, I'm Hamza Rashid
**I'm a self-taugh developer. Learning backend development and low-level programming.**

My favorite daily activities are learning about low-level concepts and performance optimization.<br/>
I daily drive **Arch Linux** and **Hyprland** Window Manager, and I also use ***neovim*** by the way.

I love building *backend services*, optimizing them, and creating command-line interface (CLI) applications to automate tedious tasks.
Why spend 6 minutes doing it manually when you can just automate it in 5 hours.

## My Work
Projects that I'm working on:

- [Drash](https://github.com/hamza12700/drash) (RUST, Linux): A better alternative to Linux `rm`
It records the original path of the file which was removed, and storing it
user's local share directory making it easy to recovery them later if you
accidentally deleted the wrong file. 

- [xLink](https://github.com/hamza12700/xlink) (GO): URL Shortener<br/>
Minimalistic web interface built using Go's standard `html/template` package and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com).<br/>
Keeping track of clicks on abbreviated URL and when it was last accessed.<br/>
Input Validation: Checks if URL is a valid URL schema. Only allow `HTTP` and `HTTPS`, also checking if URL contains TLD (Top-Level Domain).<br/>
Using Turso for storing user's and abbreviated links.<br/>
HTMX for dynamic Web UI.<br/>

## Get in Touch
I'm currently looking for a role in backend development. Iâ€™d especially love to
work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If
you're hiring, let's chat!
